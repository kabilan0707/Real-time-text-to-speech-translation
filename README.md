# Real-time-text-to-speech-translation
Text-to-Speech Translator is a Python-based application that takes a user-provided sentence, translates it into a selected target language, and converts the translated text into speech. The project demonstrates the use of natural language processing and speech synthesis to make multilingual communication easier.
